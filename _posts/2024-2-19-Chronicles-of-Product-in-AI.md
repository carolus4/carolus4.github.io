These posts are a chronicle of my journey in AI Product management. I hope you find it helpful! 

Writing is valuable for me, but I get so much energy and joy from feedback and engagement. If anything I share here helps you - even if it's because you disagree - I'd love to hear from you. 

### About me
I'm Charles, and I've been in product and startups for almost 15 years. Creating tools in a space where there's high-ambiguity motivates me. 

At Captur, I'm building Applied AI solutions for compliance. That means giving users guidance on things like how to park an escooter safely, or deliver packages securely.

### About these posts
Getting good product outcomes with AI can be hard. Common tools and frameworks don't always work, or feel incomplete.

My goal is to share stories about the process, and showcase my approach with practical examples.

If you're building products or features with an AI component, I hope these updates provide helpful perspectives.
