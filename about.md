title: Building AI Solutions People Love, with AI
permalink: /about/

My product experience is rooted in deep user empathy and a technically curious mindset. I've launched and scaled products, built teams, and raised capital.

Right now, I'm building AI-powered projects to learn more about what's possible and create real delightful everyday solutions. I used GenAI to coach me as an interviewer, transcribe, write and illustrate a first draft of my grandmothers' memoir. I'm very proud and optimistic for [Giskard]({% post_url 2025-10-16-building-giskard %}), my AI task-assistant.

I developed an entrepreneurial mindset as the first PM at Rangespan, until a [Google acquisition](https://techcrunch.com/2014/05/02/google-buys-rangespan-to-add-supply-chain-management-to-its-e-commerce-business/). I took those lessons on board as cofounder of markit!! where we build digital learning experineces for complex A-Level mathematics.

I learned about building products with research teams at [dimension](https://dimensionstudio.co/), and about scaling those products at [Captur](https://www.captur.ai/).

Honesty and optimism are values I live by—both in my work and my personal life. They’re deeply tied to how I navigate challenges and remain resilient.

I’m always eager to connect with those who are equally passionate about building great products. Let’s talk about how we can push the boundaries of what's possible.
