title: Building AI Solutions People Love, with AI
permalink: /about/
---


I’m a product leader with a passion for building things that truly improve people’s lives. My experience spans launching products, scaling teams, and raising capital—rooted in strong user empathy and a deeply technical background.

What sets me apart is my ability to learn quickly and thrive in fast-paced, high-ambiguity environments. Whether it's tackling the complex challenges of AI-driven compliance or shaping a product strategy from scratch, I love digging into the details and iterating until we find the right solution.

Most recently, I was focused on scaling Captur as we expand into the U.S., bringing real-time compliance solutions to solve pain points in micromobility, delivery and logistics. I believe people making mistakes shouldn't be the start of a reactive, frustrating process—it should be seamless, helping people get it right the first time. I’m dedicated to making this vision a reality through innovative, user-friendly solutions.

As a leader, I prioritize coaching and guiding my team through hands-on examples. Building product management craft and developing future leaders are key to what drives me forward. Honesty and optimism are values I live by—both in my work and my personal life. They’re deeply tied to how I navigate challenges and remain resilient.

I’m always eager to connect with those who are equally passionate about building great products. Let’s talk about how we can push the boundaries of what's possible.
